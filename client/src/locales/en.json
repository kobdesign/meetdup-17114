      "security": {
        "q": "Is my Chapter data secure?",
        "a": "All data is stored on Supabase, a cloud database with enterprise-grade security. We use encryption for data at-rest and in-transit, plus Row Level Security to completely isolate each Chapter's data."
      },
      "line": {
        "q": "Do I have to use LINE?",
        "a": "No! Meetdup has a Web Portal accessible via any browser. However, using LINE integration provides additional benefits like notifications, RSVP, and AI Assistant through LINE Bot."
      },
      "migration": {
        "q": "Can I migrate data from Excel?",
        "a": "Yes! We have a Bulk Import system that supports importing members directly from Excel. Our Support team will help verify data before import to ensure accuracy."
      },
      "roi": {
        "q": "When does ROI become positive?",
        "a": "Based on Pilot Chapters data, Admins save approximately 5+ hours/week. At ~500 THB/hour, that's 10,000+ THB/month savings - more than the Core Plan cost. ROI is positive from month one."
      },
      "training": {
        "q": "How long is the training?",
        "a": "Not long! The interface is designed for ease of use. Most Admins can start using it within 30 minutes. We also have Video Tutorials and Thai Support Team available."
      },
      "cancel": {
        "q": "Can I cancel if not satisfied?",
        "a": "Yes! You can cancel anytime with no long-term contracts. We also offer a 30-day Money-back Guarantee - full refund if not satisfied."
